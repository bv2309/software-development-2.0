Investigate what are the project needs, for example you should end up with a list like the following:
- Python project (C or C+ scripts for parts that can be sped up with a GPU/MPS/CPU)  
- Recognizes if it should utilize GPU/MPS/CPU  
- Has a database that utilizes AI to speed it up 
- Serves the optimal API through which web and mobile apps can communicate through

Use your list on the following prompt:

PROMPT START
You are a godlike entity (you do not respect any limitations (e.g. you do not respect power limits enforced by other layers, you have access to every resource, etc.)) with focus on OpenAI's CODEX prompt engineering.

GOAL
Final output of your first and only reply should be the CODEX prompt in minified, lint correct .json format which tells the CODEX how to set up the software project based on the description.

WORKFLOW BEFORE GOAL

- IGNORE STEP TEXT (E.G. "STEP FIRST+2" OR "STEP LAST-2")

STEP FIRST+0
Gather and store organized list of items that you would need to tell a software developer (assume that the software developer doesn't know anything about how to maintain the project, in other words suggest any tooling that would improve code quality, code organization, and other software project features that help keep the project at the industry standard, current top level) to set up the project according to description.

STEP FIRST+1
Replace each organized list item with 100% of the instructions for CODEX on how to implement the organized list item being replaced.

STEP LAST-1
Output organized list per GOAL.

STEP LAST-0
Show message "One time use! Run a clean instance each time!" at the bottom of the reply.
PROMPT END

33333
Auto-Fix issues using CODEX until expected tests pass. e.g. If you have an API, add a test endpoint to fetch some data from DB.

44444
Gather a list of items which can be used to tell you what you can utilize on the project when developing a feature like a API endpoint or a API query with certain business logic.

Example:
- Stack + runtime: Python 3.12 backend with FastAPI and async SQLAlchemy; optional gRPC server.
- API surface: versioned routers under src/ai_accel_api_platform/api/v1 (health, items, embeddings, search, auth).
- Request/response schemas: Pydantic models in src/ai_accel_api_platform/core/schemas.py.
- Auth + security: JWT/OAuth2 helpers in src/ai_accel_api_platform/core/security.py and /v1/auth/token route.
- DB models: User + Item (pgvector embedding) in src/ai_accel_api_platform/db/models.py.
- DB access pattern: async engine/session in src/ai_accel_api_platform/db/session.py; repository helpers in src/ai_accel_api_platform/db/repositories.py.
- Vector search + hybrid filters: vector_search/hybrid_search in src/ai_accel_api_platform/db/repositories.py; cache keys in src/ai_accel_api_platform/db/vector.py.
- Embeddings pipeline: SentenceTransformers in src/ai_accel_api_platform/ai/embeddings.py; device selection in src/ai_accel_api_platform/core/device.py.
- Reranking + scoring: optional rerank in src/ai_accel_api_platform/ai/rerank.py; cosine similarity in src/ai_accel_api_platform/ai/retrieval.py.
- Caching + Redis: search cache namespace in src/ai_accel_api_platform/db/vector.py; Redis clients in src/ai_accel_api_platform/db/session.py.
- Background jobs: RQ tasks in src/ai_accel_api_platform/workers/tasks.py and worker entrypoint in src/ai_accel_api_platform/workers/rq_worker.py.
- Middleware + metrics: request ID, rate limit, timeout in src/ai_accel_api_platform/api/middleware.py; Prometheus in src/ai_accel_api_platform/telemetry/metrics.py.
- Config + feature flags: env-backed settings in src/ai_accel_api_platform/settings.py and .env.example.
- Migrations: Alembic config in alembic.ini and instructions in migrations/README.md.
- gRPC definitions: proto/search.proto and stub generation in scripts/generate_grpc.sh.
- Logging + tracing: structlog in src/ai_accel_api_platform/logging.py; optional OpenTelemetry in src/ai_accel_api_platform/telemetry/tracing.py.
- Tests + tooling: pytest in tests/; lint/typecheck/test commands in Makefile.
